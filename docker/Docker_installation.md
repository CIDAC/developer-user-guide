> Note: Docker DNS configuration looks for Google DNS and your proxy domain may not be reachable at Google DNS. So, consider to use the IP address instead the domain name.

```bash
{
    "dns": ["DNS_IP", "ALTERNATIVE_DNS_IP"]
}
```

Then restart the docker service:

```bash
sudo service docker restart
```

## Alternative installation mode

If you are getting trouble trying to install Docker with the instructions above execute the commands bellow:

```bash
sudo apt install \
        apt-transport-https \
        ca-certificates \
        curl \
        gnupg2 \
        software-properties-common

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
```

> Note:
>* This should be jessie according to /etc/debian_version, but since deepin is based on unstable, stretch is the closest...

```bash
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian stretch stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list

sudo apt update

sudo apt install docker-ce

# This is most likely already created while
sudo groupadd docker installing docker

sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker

# You might need to logout if the changes are not working
newgrp docker
```
